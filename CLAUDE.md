# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains idempotent machine setup scripts for automating the configuration of fresh development environments across different operating systems. The scripts are designed to be run multiple times safely and install a consistent set of development tools.

## Key Scripts

- **mac.sh** - macOS setup using Homebrew
- **ubuntu.sh** - Ubuntu Linux setup with user management
- **windows.ps1** - Windows setup using WinGet and PowerShell
- **wsl.sh** - Windows Subsystem for Linux setup
- **pi.sh** - Raspberry Pi specific setup with ARM optimizations

## Common Development Tasks

### Running Setup Scripts Locally

```bash
# macOS
./mac.sh

# Ubuntu/WSL/Pi
sudo ./ubuntu.sh  # or ./wsl.sh, ./pi.sh

# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator)
./windows.ps1
```

### Remote Execution

Scripts are hosted at `https://scripts.scowalt.com/setup/` for remote execution via curl/wget as documented in README.md.

### Repository Management

Use `git town` and `gh` CLI tools to manage this repository:
- `git town sync` - Keep branches in sync with main
- `git town new-pull-request` - Create feature branches and PRs
- `gh pr create` - Create pull requests via GitHub CLI
- `gh pr merge` - Merge pull requests

## Architecture and Patterns

### Script Structure

All scripts follow a consistent pattern:

1. Color function definitions (cyan/green/yellow/red output)
2. SSH key verification with GitHub
3. Tool installation checks (idempotent)
4. Package manager setup
5. Individual tool installations
6. Configuration steps (dotfiles, shell setup)

### Key Design Principles

- **Idempotency**: Scripts check for existing installations before proceeding
- **Error Handling**: Failed installations are logged but don't stop execution
- **User Feedback**: Color-coded output for status messages
- **Platform-Specific**: Each script optimized for its target OS
- **Dotfile Management**: Shell configurations are managed by chezmoi - scripts should only install tools, not configure shells

### Common Tools Installed

- Version Control: git, gh (GitHub CLI), git-town
- Shell: fish (with completions), tmux
- Node.js: fnm (Fast Node Manager)
- Python: pyenv (Python version management)
- Security: 1Password CLI, Tailscale, Infisical
- Dotfiles: Chezmoi (with auto-sync)
- Terminal: Starship prompt
- CI/CD: act (local GitHub Actions)

### Important Notes

- Scripts require SSH keys to be registered with GitHub before running
- Ubuntu script enforces creation of 'scowalt' user
- All scripts configure fish as the default shell
- Chezmoi manages dotfiles with automatic git operations
- **IMPORTANT**: Do not add shell configuration (bashrc, zshrc, fish config, PowerShell profiles) in setup scripts - these are managed by chezmoi and will be overridden

## Nerd Font Symbols

### What are Nerd Fonts?

Nerd Fonts are patched fonts that include thousands of icons from popular icon sets (Font Awesome, Devicons, Octicons, etc.). These scripts use Nerd Font symbols extensively for visual feedback in terminal output.

### Working with Nerd Font Symbols as an LLM

**CRITICAL**: Nerd Font symbols appear as special Unicode characters in the code. They are essential to the visual design and MUST be preserved exactly as they appear.

#### How to handle them:

1. **Never remove or replace** existing Nerd Font symbols - they may appear as boxes, question marks, or strange characters in your text view
2. **To preserve them**: Copy the exact bytes/characters when editing lines containing these symbols
3. **To add new ones**: Use Unicode escape sequences or copy from existing usage:
   - Arrow: ‚Üí (U+2192)
   - Checkmark: ‚úì (U+2713)
   - Warning: ‚ö† (U+26A0)
   - Cross/Error: ‚úó (U+2717)
   - Sparkles: ‚ú® (U+2728)
   - Or copy the exact characters from existing print functions

#### Common symbols used in these scripts:

- Success indicators: ‚úì (checkmark)
- Error indicators: ‚úó (cross)
- Warning indicators: ‚ö† (warning sign)
- Action indicators: ‚Üí (arrow)
- Special icons: üçé (Apple emoji for macOS)

#### Example:
```bash
print_success() { printf "${GREEN}‚úì %s${NC}\n" "$1"; }  # The ‚úì is a Nerd Font symbol
```

**Remember**: These symbols are part of the user experience design. They make terminal output more readable and visually appealing.
